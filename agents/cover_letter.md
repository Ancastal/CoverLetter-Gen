Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Odoo Software Developer position at Unitiva as advertised on LinkedIn. With a strong background in software development, including substantial expertise in Python, SQL, and Java, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and help enhance the Odoo platform for your enterprise clients.

With over two years of direct experience in programming and integrating complex systems, coupled with my recent completion of a Data Science Bootcamp through Le Wagon, I have honed my analytical and problem-solving skills. My academic journey—including my Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence focused on machine translation—has equipped me with a robust understanding of how to bridge technology and business needs effectively.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity at Unitiva because of your commitment to inclusivity and your emphasis on team collaboration. I believe that my ability to work effectively in diverse teams and my proactive approach to problem-solving would make me a valuable asset to your organization. My previous freelance experience as a Java developer allowed me to develop and implement customized solutions, ensuring plugin compatibility while working closely with other developers.

I am eager to bring my unique blend of technical skills and software development experience to the Odoo Software Developer role at Unitiva. I am excited about the potential for continual learning and growth in a supportive environment, and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss further how I can contribute to your esteemed company.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing my candidacy in more detail.

Warmest regards,
